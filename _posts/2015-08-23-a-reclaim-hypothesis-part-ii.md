On Friday, I wrote a [post][1] on my excitement about OU Create now being available campus wide and then followed that up with a response to [Jim Groom][2]'s post on what my email meant within the narrative of [Reclaim Hosting][4]:

>This email feels like another giant leap in Reclaimâ€™s short history, and we could have only gotten to this point because we work with some seriously awesome folks who want to empower their community members to share far and wide.

In Part I, I thought out loud on some ideas about subdomains. And by thinking-out-loud I mostly mean going on a couple unnecessary tangents.

I've also annotated Jim's blog post using [Hypothes.is][8]. If you go to [http://via.hypothes.is/bavatuesdays.com/a-long-short-history-of-reclaim-hosting/][9], you'll see eight line-by-line comments to his post.

I explain hypothes.is as the ability to annotate line-by-line to any page on the web (kind of like brining Medium everywhere). The original intention of this post was to retell his story from my point of view and sort of go line-by-line from his recollection. Instead, I decided to use this as a test case to use hypothes.is for the first time. You can see that my annotations have also been aggregated to my own Hypothes.is [public stream][10]:

My mind is kind of blown thinking about how we can bring a social experience to online reading anywhere and then have our own record of said conversations...

A big shout out to [Jeremy Dean][5] who responded by when I sent out the following tweet:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Anybody have any use cases of <a href="http://t.co/gpZo1Fs4TM">http://t.co/gpZo1Fs4TM</a> in the classroom?

I liked the idea of students having an assignment where they contribute to a large body of work like Genius, which brings annotation ability to lyrics. Personally, I love utilizing the website to look at perspectives on song meanings and it seemed like an interesting enough assignment idea. Anyways, Jeremy happened to have started the Education division of Genius, but has since left to join forces with [Jon Udell][6] on hypothes.is. He was superb in helping me understand how it works. I also have to admit that I'm a fan of any tech venture that references the [memex][7] in their promotional video:

Thanks Jeremy!
