Last week I was inspired by a <a href="http://iqc.ou.edu/2014/04/24/streetview/" target="_blank">blog post</a> from the OU <a href="http://iqc.ou.edu" target="_blank">Institute for Quality Communities</a>, which leveraged Google Map&#8217;s new <a href="http://www.gearthblog.com/blog/archives/2014/04/google-releases-historical-street-view-feature.html" target="_blank">historical imagery street view feature</a> and GIFs to show the growth of OKC over the last five years. I was curious to do the same for OU as well to see if Google Earth Streetview what  snapshot of construction at OU since 2008 could be perused. A few neat findings:

##### 1. Growth of the OU Research Campus

##### 2. Addition of Sammy B to Heisman Park

##### 3. New School of Social Work Building (Zarrow Hall) / Demo of Rhyne Hall

##### 4. Finishing of Devon Energy Hall

##### 5. Utility Plant Construction

There are a few key projects that unfortunately wasn&#8217;t recaptured by the Google Street View cars. Namely, the second phase addition of Gaylord Hall and the renovation of Gould Hall. There&#8217;s a good chance that Asp Ave. was blocked off due to construction when Google was making the rounds. It&#8217;s also very impressive how much better the camera quality is. The 2013 images are much clearer than the 2008 images.

One last thing I accidentally discovered perusing Google Maps was this collection of campus panoramic shots by <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/views/profile/115622432590629378233?gl=us" target="_blank">Kevin Burns</a>, a local photographer. He happened to capture the South Oval one rainy morning last Fall, right before the mums bloom for Homecoming:

Burns</a></small>

You can check out some more of Kevin&#8217;s panoramic&#8217;s on this <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/views/profile/115622432590629378233?gl=us" target="_blank">Google Maps | Views page</a> which include inside the football stadium and the National Weather Center at night. This lead me down a *new* rabbit hole of what does it take to be a &#8220;Google Trusted&#8221; photographer. Ya know, cause that would probably make a pretty cool business card.
