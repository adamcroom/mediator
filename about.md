**About the Blog**

The original intent of this space was to serve an outlet to reflect and expand on thoughts and conversations. Over it&#8217;s short existence, I&#8217;ve found myself address more professional topics than personal ones. However you landed here, I hope this space serves you as much as it serves me.

**About Me**

I live in [Norman, OK][2] with my wonderful wife, Katie, and our two daughters, Faye and Lucy. Our family enjoys taking advantage of the cultural activities in Norman by attending numerous local festivals, going to the parks, dining out, and attending OU football games. We attend [Summit Church][3] in Newcastle, OK where I play guitar in the worship band and my wife and I lead a young families home group.

I am the Director for Digital Learning at the <a href="http://ou.edu" target="_blank">University of Oklahoma</a> <a href="http://www.ou.edu/cte/" target="_blank">Center for Teaching Excellence</a>, which better assists our faculty with implementing technology-driven course enhancements. Professionally, I am passionate about three things (that nicely build off each other):

1. Great education and great learning experiences. Period.  
2. Better access to great education and learning experiences.  
3. Understanding how technology can be leveraged to create better access to great education and learning experiences.

I am also an adjunct instructor for the <a href="http://www.ou.edu/gaylord" target="_blank">Gaylord College of Journalism and Mass Communication</a> and teach a Public Relations design class. You can follow my students progress [here][4].

In 2010 I founded <a href="http://tedxou.com/" target="_blank">TEDxOU</a>, an independently-organized TED event. Since then, I have organized six TEDx events and produced 30+ Talks which have accumulated more than half a million views in 120+ countries worldwide.

I am also the Project Director for <a href="http://freedom.ou.edu/" target="_blank">freedom.ou.edu</a>, an online platform dedicated to bringing civic education to the world from the OU <a href="http://iach.ou.edu" target="_blank">Institute for the American Constitutional Heritage</a> . We produce a podcast series (and the first OU <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/freedom-101-introduction-to/id570801351" target="_blank">iTunesU course</a>) called Freedom 101. The platform also hosts a full 18-lecture course titled &#8220;<a href="http://freedom.ou.edu/category/story-of-freedom/" target="_blank">The Story of Freedom is America</a>&#8221; by <a href="http://drfears.com/" target="_blank">Dr. J. Rufus Fears</a>. Story of Freedom has frequently been in the Top 10 Courses on <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/story-of-freedom-in-america/id577784651" target="_blank">iTunesU </a>and continues to serve 35,000+ digital students.

Because of my work with freedom.ou.edu, I won a really fancy trophy (and this <a href="http://freedom.ou.edu/wp-content/uploads/innovator-1024x682.jpg" target="_blank">picture</a> to prove it) and was named an <a href="http://freedom.ou.edu/innovator-of-the-year/" target="_blank">Innovator of the Year Honoree</a> by the <a href="http://journalrecord.com/" target="_blank">Journal Record</a>.

This year we are piloting an ambitious program where we [offer OU students and faculty free domains][5] (just like this one) and see what they can leverage their classrooms to create.
